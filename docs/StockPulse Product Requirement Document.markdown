## 1. Executive Summary

**Project Name**: StockPulse  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: May 3, 2025  
**Prepared by**: Grok, acting as Product Owner and Product Manager  

StockPulse is a web-based application designed to empower retail investors in Vietnam and beyond by providing aggregated financial news, stock market data, and educational content on long-term investment strategies.

## 2. Market Analysis

### 2.1 Market Landscape
The financial app market in Vietnam is expanding, with a projected 24% fintech market share by 2025, according to [Emerging personal finance applications in Vietnam](https://b-company.jp/emerging-personal-finance-applications-in-vietnam/). Apps like Viettel Money, MB Bank, and Momo dominate banking and payments, while [FiinPro](https://fiingroup.vn/FiinPro) offers professional-grade financial data for a fee. Stock trading apps are also emerging, as noted in [Top 5 Stock Market Apps in Vietnam](https://mytour.vn/en/blog/bai-viet/top-5-stock-market-apps-in-vietnam-right-now.html), but few focus on news aggregation or education for retail investors. Globally, platforms like Yahoo Finance and Stock Titan provide comprehensive data but lack localization for Vietnamese users.

### 2.3 Unique Selling Points (USPs)
- **Localized Content**: Focus on Vietnam’s stock markets (HOSE, HNX) and local news sources like CafeF.
