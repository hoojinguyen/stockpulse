# Architecture Documentation for StockPulse

## 1. Introduction

**Project Name**: StockPulse  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: May 3, 2025  
**Prepared by**: Grok, Solution Architect  

StockPulse is a web-based application designed to empower retail investors, particularly in Vietnam, by providing aggregated financial news, stock market data, and educational content on long-term investment strategies. This document outlines the system architecture, technology stack, and implementation details to meet the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the Product Requirement Document (PRD). As a pet project for a software engineer, the architecture prioritizes simplicity, scalability, and learning opportunities while leveraging your frontend expertise in Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

StockPulse adopts a **multi-tier architecture** to ensure separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. The architecture comprises the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**: Handles user interactions, displaying news, stock data, and educational content.
- **Application Layer (Backend)**: Manages business logic, API integrations, and data processing.
- **Data Layer (Database)**: Stores user data, preferences, and watchlists.
- **Integration Layer (APIs)**: Interfaces with external services for news and stock data.
- **Caching Layer**: Optimizes performance by storing frequently accessed data.

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture Diagram

```
[User] --> [Frontend (Next.js)] --> [Backend (Node.js/Express)] --> [Database (PostgreSQL)] 
                          |                                       |
                          |--> [Caching (Redis)]                 |
                          |                                       |
                          |--> [APIs (NewsAPI, Yahoo Finance)]  |
```

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and API routes, ensuring fast load times and SEO benefits.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for lightweight, scalable APIs.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage, with Supabase as an alternative for easier setup.
- **Caching**: Redis for caching news and stock data to reduce API calls and improve response times.
- **APIs**: External services like [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) for news and [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) (via `yfinance`) for stock data.

### 2.2 Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Separate frontend, backend, and data layers for easier maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Use caching and cloud hosting to handle increased traffic.
- **Simplicity**: Prioritize free, reliable APIs and tools to keep the MVP manageable.
- **Compliance**: Include disclaimers to avoid legal issues related to financial advice.

- **Testing**: Jest (unit tests), Cypress (end-to-end tests)
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier

## 4. Component Interactions

### 4.1 User Flow
1. **Registration/Login**:
   - User accesses the frontend (Next.js) and signs up/logs in.
   - Clerk handles authentication, storing user tokens securely.
   - User preferences (e.g., news categories, watchlists) are saved in PostgreSQL.
2. **News Aggregation**:
   - Frontend sends a request to the backend for news.
   - Backend checks Redis cache; if empty, fetches from NewsAPI and caches for 5 minutes.
   - News is displayed in a filterable list.
3. **Stock Information**:
   - Frontend requests stock data (e.g., VNM, FPT) via backend API.
   - Backend checks Redis; if empty, fetches from `yfinance` and caches for 1 minute.
   - Data is displayed in tables or charts (Chart.js).
4. **Educational Content**:
   - Static articles (e.g., on index funds) are served via Next.js pages.
   - Dynamic content (e.g., historical VN-Index returns) is fetched from the backend.
5. **Watchlists**:
   - Users add stocks to watchlists via the frontend.
   - Data is stored in PostgreSQL and displayed with real-time updates (if implemented).

### 4.2 API Endpoints
| **Endpoint** | **Method** | **Description** | **Parameters** |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| `/api/news` | GET | Fetch news | `category`, `query` |
| `/api/stocks` | GET | Fetch stock data | `tickers` |
| `/api/watchlist` | POST | Add to watchlist | `userId`, `ticker` |
| `/api/watchlist` | GET | Get watchlist | `userId` |

### 4.3 Data Flow
- **User Data**: Stored in PostgreSQL (e.g., user profiles, watchlists).
- **News/Stock Data**: Fetched from APIs, cached in Redis, served to frontend.
- **Educational Content**: Stored as static files or in PostgreSQL for dynamic data.

## 5. Scalability and Performance

- **Caching**: Redis caches news (5-minute expiry) and stock data (1-minute expiry) to reduce API calls.
- **Load Balancing**: Vercel and Railway provide built-in load balancing.
- **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL supports read replicas for future scaling.
- **API Optimization**: Implement rate limiting and batch requests to manage API quotas.

## 6. Security and Compliance

- **Authentication**: Clerk uses JWT tokens, with optional 2FA.
- **Data Encryption**: HTTPS for data in transit; PostgreSQL encryption for data at rest.
- **Compliance**:
  - Disclaimers on every page: “For informational purposes only, not investment advice.”
  - Adhere to Vietnam’s cybersecurity and financial regulations.
- **API Security**:
  - Store API keys in environment variables.
  - Use CORS to restrict backend access to the frontend.

## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Phase 1: MVP (1-2 Months)
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up Next.js with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
  - Integrate NewsAPI for news feed.
  - Integrate `yfinance` for stock data (e.g., VNM, FPT).
  - Build UI for news and stock pages.
  - Deploy on Vercel.
- **Sample Code**:
  ```jsx
  // pages/index.js (Next.js)
  import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
  import axios from 'axios';

  export default function Home() {
    const [news, setNews] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
      axios.get('/api/news').then(res => setNews(res.data));
    }, []);

    return (
      <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">StockPulse News</h1>
        {news.map(article => (
          <div key={article.url} className="my-4">
            <h2>{article.title}</h2>
            <p>{article.description}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

### 7.2 Phase 2: Backend and Authentication (1 Month)
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up Node.js/Express with Prisma and PostgreSQL.
  - Implement Clerk for authentication.
  - Enable watchlist functionality.
  - Add Redis for caching.
- **Sample Code**:
  ```javascript
  // server.js (Node.js/Express)
  const express = require('express');
  const redis = require('redis');
  const axios = require('axios');
  const app = express();
  const client = redis.createClient();

  app.get('/api/news', async (req, res) => {
    const cached = await client.get('news');
    if (cached) return res.json(JSON.parse(cached));

    const response = await axios.get('https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines', {
      params: { apiKey: process.env.NEWS_API_KEY, category: 'business' }
    });
    await client.setEx('news', 300, JSON.stringify(response.data.articles));
    res.json(response.data.articles);
  });

  app.listen(3001, () => console.log('Server running on port 3001'));
  ```

### 7.3 Phase 3: Enhancements (1-2 Months)
- **Tasks**:
  - Add static educational content (e.g., articles on index funds).
  - Implement portfolio tracking (manual input).
  - Optimize for mobile with Tailwind CSS.
  - Explore VADER for sentiment analysis (optional).

### 7.4 Deployment
- **Frontend**: Deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with automatic builds.
- **Backend**: Deploy on [Railway](https://railway.app/) for managed hosting.
- **Database**: Use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for PostgreSQL and auth.
